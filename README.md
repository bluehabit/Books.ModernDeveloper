For section 1 container, Eloquent Javascript, I added floats to all of the invidual elements. 

class 'book-right-portion' for image
class 'sliders' for the easy to follow, comprehensive, enough examples

added a section where the suser can buy the book on various websites such as amazon or gumroad.

added clearfix class to prevent floated elements parent containers from collapsing

Minor formatting, text and color changes to more accuratley reflect the mock up. 


added progress bars for sliders, classes are .progress-bar for 
the background and .progress-bar span for the % complete they are all contained within the div with an id of graph-container
